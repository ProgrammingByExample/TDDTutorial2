# Test code you have not written yet â€” using mocks
This is the code created to demonstrate some basic test driven development concepts in this [article](https://scottgarryfoster.medium.com/7416d647b992).
This code seeks to provide a small project with a few tests which may be played around with or simply viewed to gain further understanding.
## Installation
### Visual Studio
This code was created using **Visual Studio 2022 Community edition**. 
It is likely this would open in Visual studio as far back as 2017 as the project solution files have hardly changed. 
The easiest way to use this code is therefore to open the project in VS2022 using the **.sln**.
### Rider
For Rider, this project should open and has been tested in **Rider 2022. 1 .2**. You will likely need to get the plugin for **Moq** however Rider should notify you of this and give you a nice menu to install.
